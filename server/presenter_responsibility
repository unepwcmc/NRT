# Why use this rather than just modifying the model?
* Handlebars disallows logic, so instead you must pre-build objects in the controller with all needed data
* Mongoose instances are fussy about modifying attributes
* Extensive modification of model objects feels "odd" anyway

# What do presenters do?
* Creates a object clone of given model
* Populate methods:
  1. Query the model for data
  2. Modifies the object clone
* presenter[modelName] returns the populated object
