# National Reporting Toolkit

NRT is an online system to help Governments collect, analyse and publish
environmental information quickly and easily. Itâ€™s being built by the
UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, in partnership with the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Abu Dhabi Global
Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI). You can find out more at
[nrt.io](http://nrt.io)

## Technical Architecture
NRT is a web application, written in CoffeeScript. The server component
runs on Node.js and connects to a MongoDB NoSQL back-end. The client-side
component (which runs in the user's browser) is also written in CoffeeScript,
and precompiled to JavaScript before being sent to the user. The more extensive
client-side components use [Backbone.js](), with [Diorama]() extensions for view nesting.

## User Management

A simple user management system is in place, with a CRUD (minus the U)
API. A secret token is required to authenticate yourself and manage
users. This token is set by an environment variable, `AUTH_TOKEN`.

For example, run your app as so:

    AUTH_TOKEN=my-very-secret-token npm start

#### Listing all users

    curl http://<domain>/api/users\?token\=my-very-secret-token

#### Adding a user

    curl -X POST -d "email=hats@boats.com&password=password" http://<domain>/api/users\?token\=my-very-secret-token

#### Deleting a user

    curl -i -X DELETE http://<domain>/api/users/<id>\?token\=my-very-secret-token
